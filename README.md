## Extensible Collapsing Menu (via Web Component APIs)
## by Erik Kimsey
### erikkimsey.com

As an effort to impress Silverchair with my code challenge, I decided to learn how to create custom Web Components.  That is, rather than hard-code the code-challenge's menu, I decided to make the menu a standalone Web Component.  

The process of learning the nuances of Web Component APIs and architecture (i.e., custom elements, the `<template>` element, Shadow DOM) was fascinating.  But, ultimately, became a 10-hour endeavour.  

Thus, I am submitting this incomplete Web Component as well as the styled into which the component was to apply.

##### Instructions
There's not much to see, live. But, if you want to run it...
1. Clone this repo to your computer,
2. In terminal, navigate to the cloned repo,
3. In terminal, run `npm install` and `npm start`.

### Thanks!
